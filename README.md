# Advent Of Code

In this repository, you will find solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems using multiple languages.

Please, bear in mind that I'm not a competitive programmer, so the idea behind this repository is to write code as readable as posible (although sometimes I was a bit tired to do so :grin:).

Also, you might find a lot of comments in the code. This is because I use these problems to learn about algorithms, data structures, and even the quirks/features of the language, so the idea is to document my thought process, explain some ideas found in other solutions that I implemented into my code or just justify why I did something in a specific way.

>During AoC 2023, I decided that since time is tight and I'm primarily doing this to learn new languages, I'd allow myself to look at (mostly) visualizations or even solutions in other languages I'm more comfortable with, but only if I get stuck after spending significant time on a problem. When I do so, I try to add a link to the Reddit posts that helped me.
