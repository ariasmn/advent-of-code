# Advent Of Code

In this repository, you will find solutions for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems using multiple languages.

Please, bear in mind that I'm not a competitive programmer, so the idea behind this repository is to write code as readable as posible (although sometimes I was a bit tired to do so :grin:).

Also, you might find a lot of comments in the code. This is because I use these problems to learn about algorithms, data structures, and even the quirks/features of the language, so the idea is to document my thought process, explain some ideas found in other solutions that I implemented into my code or just justify why I did something in a specific way.
